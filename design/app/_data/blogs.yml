  intro: "
  Your team invested countless hours in development.
  <br />
  Your QA people can barely keep their eyes open - they have worked so hard. Your lead developer who's responsible for the deployment is almost dehydrated from so much pressure and sweat.
<br />
  But it's all worth it. Your app is live. Now everybody goes to sleep, and your pampered app, is all alone, serving your data to the entire world.
<br />
  You forgot one thing - to give it a phone to call home, and tell you something went wrong.

  intro: "
  Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
  Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
  when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
  specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
   electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised
   in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum
   passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus
   PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
